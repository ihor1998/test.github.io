## Hello, User!
  
  You see the app - [“Planner”](https://ihor1998.github.io/test.github.io/). There you can plan your events, throughout the one working week. Everyday from 10am to 18pm you can book only one hour for an event provided this cell has not already booked. 

### Let’s go to functional: 

#### Window “create event”:

#### Here you need to indicate necessary information about your event, namely:

1) Name of the event:

 2) Participants list:

 3) Day:

4) Time:

![button](./img/image_2021-02-13_16-50-20.png)

Push the button “create” for the event to appear on the Planner or push the button “cancel” if you change your mind. 
After cancelling you will be on the page “Planner”.

A prerequisite for creating an event is the presence of the event name and participants. 
If you missed one of these graphs, then we will definitely inform you.
